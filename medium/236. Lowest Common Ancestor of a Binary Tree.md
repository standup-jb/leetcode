# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
##Problems:
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary search tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

##Note: 

##Example 1:
>Input:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1</br>
Output:3<br>
Explanation: The LCA of of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

##Example 2:
>
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4<br>
Output: 5<br>
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself
             according to the LCA definition.
##Solution:

``` java

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root==null||root==p||root==q){
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,p,q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right,p,q);
        if(left==null){
            return right;
        }else{
            if(right==null){
                return left;
            }else{
                return root;
            }
        }
    }
}
